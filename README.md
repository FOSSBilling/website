This repository contains the source for [fossbilling.org](https://fossbilling.org).

## Built using
* Next.js
* Tailwind CSS

## Localization
Please **do not** edit any locale files by hand. We have a Crowdin Enterprise instance and like the main project, we use that for localizing the website. You can sign up at [translate.fossbilling.org](https://translate.fossbilling.org) and start contributing right now!
### I can't find my language!
We're trying hard to find new people to help us reach new languages. If you're willing to translate FOSSBilling into your language and maintaining the locales in the future, join our [Discord server](https://fossbilling.org/discord) and leave a message to the **"#localization"** channel. Thank you very much for showing your interest :)

## Deployment
The website will be rebuilt automatically after every push and deployed to Vercel. Outside contributors don't need to do anything do get the website deployed. Team members should have access to the Vercel account.
